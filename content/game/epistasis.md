## About the game
---

Epistasis is a horror game where you are tasked with exploring an abandoned space station and figuring out what *really* happened there. Be wary however, as it's not as empty as it seems...

We worked on the game as a team of 5 people from January 2023 to May 2023, during our final year at Business College Helsinki.

## My contributions
---
### Gameplay
* Created the **base player interaction system** used in large parts of the game (puzzles, pick-ups, etc.)
* Developed and maintained the player controller.
* Implemented most of the game's audio.

### UI
* Developed the **dialogue system**, responsible for playing **fully voiced** dialogue and displaying the appropriate subtitles.
* Created an **automated** options system, which allowed us to efficiently create and implement 20+ player settings.
* Upgraded **Overlay UI**-only puzzles to immersive **diegetic ones**.
* Created an immersive "wrist watch"-style UI, including it's view-state and dynamic display of information, which **replaced** a majority of the HUD.
* Developed the entire minimap system.
* Replaced the default UI graphics to ones from an **asset pack**.
* Implemented **world-space popups** to display the names of interactable objects.

### Testing
* Actively participated in planning, setting up and executing on testing sessions.
* Observed testers and analyzed feedback to find the most important issues.
* Imported an in-game developer console.

### Workflow
* Set up and maintained the **Jira environment** used throughout the project.

### Publishing
* Edited the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoSNThJUqoI).
* Created and wrote the details for the itch.io page.

### Optimization
* Optimized heavy assets to fit the game's **build size** under itch.io's limits.

## What I learned
---
I would say that the most valuable thing I learned from this project was on how to collaborate with a team of programmers and what it is like working full-time on a long-term project.

Because the project management was largely up to us, we figured out the Agile *workflow* and it's tools as a team, which was a very effective way of learning it's fundementals and advantages.

On the technical side, I learned more about Unity's capabilities in 3D, particularly when working with UI, audio and HDRP.
