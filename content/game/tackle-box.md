## About the game
---

Tackle Box: The First Catch is a fishing-fighting hybrid where you play as an old man and you need to fight every catch with your bare hands.

We worked on the game as a team of 7 people from August 2025 to December 2025 as a part of our 3rd-year studies at Jamk University of Applied Sciences. The game was released on Steam on 12.12.2025.

## My contributions
---
### Gameplay
* Created a **robust and easily expandable** system for handling different phases of gameplay (e.g. moving from fishing to fighting) using **Unity's Behavior Graphs**.
* **Collaborated with designers** to implement fighting system.
* Created fishing minigame by **iterating** over **several prototypes**.
* Worked with 3D artist to create an **efficient workflow** to implement 12+ fish enemies.
    * Got it down to ~15 minutes to implement a new fish
* Created cutscenes using **Unity's Timeline System**.
* Implemented 22 Steam Achievements using the **Steamworks API**.

### UI
* **Worked with UI artist** to plan and implement the game's UI.
* Implemented a system to dynamically display appropriate **button prompts** for controller/keyboard.
* Created a simple dialogue system using **Scriptable Objects**.

### Testing
* Actively participated in planning, setting up and executing on testing sessions, based on my experiences with [Epistasis](/game/epistasis).
* Observed testers, analyzed feedback and compiled it to a consise list of issues.

### Workflow
* Maintained an **implementation plan** and worked with the visual and sound team to keep them up to date on the necessary assets.

### Audio
* Implemented audio using an open-source plugin.

### Publishing
* Worked with artists and writers for the content of the Steam store page.
* Created and set up Mac version of the game on Steam.

## What I learned
---
This project, I learned most about making a new type of game and working with a team of artists.

Developing this kind of game was also new to me in it's fragmented gameplay loop, with it constantly jumping from one kind of game to another. This forced me to approach it's development in a new way and learn new systems and techniques.

Through this, I learned more about Unity's toolset, like the Timeline system and Behavior Graphs (although I probably didn't use it as exactly intended).

Part of the project was to publish the game on Steam, so I got some valuable experience of figuring that out and implementing features of the Steamworks API in Unity.
